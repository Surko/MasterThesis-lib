It contains interfaces and classes with generator of starting individuals.
<p> Package contains interface: <br>
- PopulationInitializator is the main interface that all the population initializators must implement <br>
- TreePopulationInitializator is the submain interface that all the tree population initializators must implement <br>
</p>
<p> Package contains classes: <br>
- CompletedTrees is the tree population initializator that initialize the population with individuals generated by generators without change<br>
- WekaCompletedTrees is the tree population initializator that initialize the population only for weka with individuals generated by generators without change<br>
- RandomStumpCombinator is the tree population initializator that initialize the population with decision stump individuals generated by generators. Those stumps are combined to reach some height<br>
- WekaRandomStumpCombinator is the tree population initializator that initialize the population only for weka with decision stump individuals generated by generators. Those stumps are combined to reach some height <br>
