It contains packages, interfaces and classes that are in some way used in evolution algorithm
<p> Package contains packages: <br>
- fitness is the package with all the fitness functions and comparators used in EA<br>
- individuals is the package with container for each individual<br>
- operators is the package with all the operators (mutation and crossover) used in EA  <br>
- population is the package with container for population of individuals <br>
- selectors is the package with all the selectors (mating and environmental) <br>
</p>
<p> Package contains classes: <br>
- EvolutionAlgorithm is the main class that execute the steps of evolution algorithm. It uses all the component (selectors, operators, fitness functions) from this package
and creates the new individuals.<br>
